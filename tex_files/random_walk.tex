In the construction of queueing processes as set out in
Section~\ref{sec:constr-discr-time} we are given two sequences of
i.i.d. random variables: the number of arrivals $\{a_k\}$ per period
and the service capacities $\{c_k\}$. Assuming that jobs can be served
in the period they arrive, the departure and queue length processes
are generated by the recursions
\begin{equation}\label{eq:5}
  \begin{split}
  Q_k &= [Q_{k-1}+a_k - c_k]^+,\\
  d_k &= Q_{k-1} +a_k- Q_{k},
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
where $[x]^+ := \max\{x, 0\}$.  

\begin{question}
  What is the difference between the recursive schemes of~(\ref{eq:5}) and~(\ref{eq:31})? Explain in the former scheme
  the formula for $d_k$.  
  \begin{hint}
When are the arrivals in slot $k$
    available for service in either of the systems?
  \end{hint}
\begin{solution}
  In the scheme
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{split}
      d_k &= \min\{Q_{k-1}, c_k\}\\
Q_k &= Q_{k-1} + a_k - d_k,
    \end{split}
  \end{equation*}
the arrivals are assumed to arrive \emph{at the end} of period $k$. 

When we use the other scheme,
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{split}
      Q_k &= [Q_{k-1} + a_k - c_k]^+,\\
      d_k &= Q_{k-1} + a_k - Q_k,
    \end{split}
  \end{equation*}
  we assume that the arrivals are available at the start of the $k$th
  slot. Observe that the number of jobs that enter the $k$th slot is
  $Q_{k-1}+a_k$. The number that remain at the end is $Q_k$. Thus, the
  number of jobs that depart must be the difference between what
  enters and what is left behind.
\end{solution}
\end{question}


Observe now that the relation for $Q_k$
shares a resemblance to a random walk $\{Z_k, k=0,1,\ldots\}$ with  $Z_k$ 
given by
\begin{equation*}
  Z_k = Z_{k-1} + a_k - c_k.
\end{equation*}
Clearly, $\{Z_k\}$ is `free', i.e., it can take positive and negative
values, but $\{Q_k\}$ is restricted to the non-negative integers.  In
this section we show how to build the queueing process $\{Q_k\}$ from
the random walk $\{Z_k\}$ by a device called a \emph{reflection map}.
Besides the elegance of this construction, the construction leads to
spectacularly fast simulations. Moreover, we can use the probabilistic
tools that have been developed for the random walk to analyze queueing
systems. One example is the distribution of the time until an
especially large queue length is reached; these times can be
formulated as \emph{hitting times} of the random walk. Another example
is the average time it takes to clear a large queue.

\begin{question}
Show that  $Q_k$ satisfies the relation
\begin{equation}\label{eq:reich1}
  Q_k = Z_k - \min_{0\leq i \leq k} Z_i\wedge 0,
\end{equation}
where $Z_k$ is defined by the above random walk and
$a\wedge b = \min\{a,b\}$ 

\begin{hint}
Note first that from the expression for $Z_k$,
  $a_k - c_k = Z_k - Z_{k-1}$. Use this to get
  $Q_k = [Q_{k-1} +Z_k- Z_{k-1}]^+$. Subtract $Z_k$, use recursion and
  use subsequently,
\begin{align*}
&\max\{\max\{a,b\}, c\} = \max\{a,b,c\}, \\
&Q_0 = Z_0, \\
&\max\{-a, -b \} = -\min\{a,b\}.
\end{align*}
\end{hint}
 
\begin{solution}
Note first that from the expression
for $Z_k$, $a_k - c_k = Z_k - Z_{k-1}$. Using this in the recursion
for $Q_k$, we get
\begin{equation*}
  Q_k = [Q_{k-1} +Z_k- Z_{k-1}]^+,
\end{equation*}
thus, 
\begin{equation*}
  Q_k - Z_{k} = \max\{Q_{k-1} - Z_{k-1}, -Z_k\}.
\end{equation*}
From this, and using recursion, we see that
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{split}
  Q_k - Z_{k} 
% &= \max\{Q_{k-1} - Z_{k-1}, -Z_k\} \\
&= \max\{\max\{Q_{k-2} - Z_{k-2}, -Z_{k-1}\}, -Z_k\} \\
&= \max\{Q_{k-2} - Z_{k-2}, -Z_{k-1}, -Z_k\} \\
&= \max\{Q_{0} - Z_{0}, -Z_1, \ldots, -Z_k\} \\
&= \max\{0, -Z_1, \ldots, -Z_k\} \\
&= - \min\{0, Z_1, \ldots, Z_k\},
  \end{split}
  \end{equation*}
where we subsequently use that
\begin{align*}
&\max\{\max\{a,b\}, c\} = \max\{a,b,c\}, \\
&Q_0 = Z_0, \\
&\max\{-a, -b \} = -\min\{a,b\}.
\end{align*}
 
For further discussion, if you are interested, refer to
  \citet{baccelli88:_sampl_m_m}.
\end{solution}
\end{question}

This recursion for $Q_k$ leads to really
interesting graphs, see Figures~\ref{fig:random_bernoulli}
and~\ref{fig:random_walk}. We consider two examples. Let
$a_k \sim B(0.3)$, i.e., $a_k$ is Bernoulli-distributed with success
parameter $p=0.3$, i.e., $\P{a_k = 1} = 0.3 = 1- \P{a_k=0}$, and
$c_k \sim B(0.4)$. As a second example, we take $a_k\sim B(0.49)$ and
construct the random walk as
\begin{equation*}
  Z_k = Z_{k-1} + 2 a_k -1.
\end{equation*}
Thus, if $a_k=1$, the random walk increases by one step, while if
$a_k=0$, the random walk decreases by one step.

Now that we have seen that random walks can be converted into queueing
systems, we can study the transient distribution,
i.e., the distribution as a function of time, of the random walk
$\{Z_k\}$. 

\begin{question}  The
  free $M/M/1$ queue is a queueing process that can become
  negative. Thus, it is just the random walk
\begin{equation*}
  Z(t) = Z(0) + N_\lambda(t) - N_\mu(t), 
\end{equation*}
where the arrival process is a Poisson process $N_\lambda(t)$ and the
departure process is a Poisson process $N_\mu(t)$. Show that
\begin{equation*}
    \P{Z(t)=n}_m 
= e^{-(\lambda+\mu)t} \left(\frac\lambda\mu\right)^{(n-m)/2} \sum_{k=0}^\infty 
\frac{(t\sqrt{\lambda\mu} )^{2k+m-n}}{k!(k+m-n)!},
\end{equation*}
where $\P{\cdot}_m$ means that the random walk starts at $m$, i.e.,
$Z(0)=m$ 

As an aside, the summation includes negative factorials when
$k+m-n<0$. The tacit assumption is to take $n!\in \{\pm \infty\}$ for
$n\in \Z_-$. Another way to get around this problem is to take
$k=\max\{0, m-n\}$..
\begin{hint}
It is actually not hard, even though the expression looks
  hard. Use conditioning to see that
  $\P{Z(t)=n}_m = \P{N_\mu(t) - N_\lambda(t) = m - n}$. Then write out
  the definitions of the two Poisson distributions. Assemble
  terms. Then fiddle a bit with the terms to get
  $(t\sqrt{\lambda\mu})$. 
\end{hint}


\begin{solution}
With this we have a characterization of the queue length process as a
function of time until it hits zero for the first time. What can we
say about the distribution of $Q(t)$? With the above random walk, 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:29}
  \begin{split}
    \P{Z(t)=n}_m
&= \P{m+N_\lambda(t) - N_\mu(t) = n }  = \P{N_\lambda(t) - N_\mu(t) = n-m }  \\
&= \P{N_\mu(t) - N_\lambda(t) = m-n }  \\
&= \sum_{k=0}^\infty \P{N_\mu(t) = k - n + m\given N_\lambda(t) = k } \P{N_\lambda(t)=k}\\
&= \sum_{k=0}^\infty e^{-\mu t} \frac{(\mu t)^{k -n+m}}{(k-n +m)!} e^{-\lambda t} \frac{(\lambda t)^k}{k!} \\
&= e^{-(\lambda+\mu)t} \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{(\lambda t)^k(\mu t)^{k  -n + m }}{k!(k-n+m)!}.
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
We can write this a bit simpler by noting that
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{split}
  (\lambda t)^k (\mu t) ^{k + m - n} t^{k+m-n} 
&=  \lambda^k t^k\mu^{k + m - n} t^{k+m-n} \\
&= \lambda^k \mu^{k + m - n} (t\sqrt{\lambda \mu})^{2k+m-n} (\lambda\mu)^{-k + (n-m)/2} \\
&= (\lambda/\mu)^{(n-m)2} (t\sqrt{\lambda \mu})^{2k+m-n}.
  \end{split}
\end{equation*}
With this,
\begin{equation*}
    \P{Z(t)=n} 
= e^{-(\lambda+\mu)t} \left(\frac\lambda\mu\right)^{(n-m)/2} \sum_{k=0}^\infty 
\frac{(t\sqrt{\lambda\mu} )^{2k+m-n}}{k!(k+m-n)!}.
\end{equation*}
  
\end{solution}
\end{question}


\begin{question}
  Can you relate the construction of $\{Q_k\}$ as a discrete-time
  random walk to a continuous-time construction of the $M/M/1$ queue?

  \begin{hint}
Consider $Z(t)=Z(0) + N_\lambda( t) -N_\mu(t)$ at the embedded
    set of epochs at which either $N_\lambda$ or $N_\mu$ changes. What
    is the probability that $N_\lambda$ fires, given that one of the
    two Poisson processes fires? Relate this to $\{a_k\}$ and
    $\{c_k\}$.
  \end{hint}

    \begin{solution}
      We use that merging two Poisson processes leads to another
      Poisson process and that a Poisson process can be split with
      Bernoulli random variables to form a thinned Poisson
      process. See one of the exercises of
      Section~\ref{sec:poisson-distribution}. 

      Consider the Poisson process $N_{\lambda+\mu}(t)$. This counting
      process has, for fixed $t$, the same distribution as
      $N_\lambda(t)+N_\mu(t)$. Let $\{A_k\}$ be the epochs at which
      the arrivals of $N_{\lambda+\mu}(t)$ occur. At $A_k$, throw a
      coin that lands heads with probability $\lambda/(\lambda+\mu)$
      and tails with probability $\mu/(\lambda+\mu)$. Set $a_k=1$ and
      $c_k=0$ if the coin lands heads, and set $a_k=0$ and $c_k=1$ if
      it turns tails. The processes
      \begin{align*}
        N_\lambda(t) &= \sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k \1{A_k \leq t},\\
        N_\mu(t) &= \sum_{k=1}^\infty c_k \1{A_k \leq t},
      \end{align*}
      are our original Poisson processes.  Observe that with this
      procedure we have established a relation between the sequences
      $\{a_k\}$ and $\{c_k\}$ and the Poisson processes $N_\lambda$ and $N_\mu$. 

      The process $Z_k = Z_{k-1}+a_k - c_k$ is a random walk in
      discrete time and its reflection results in the discrete-time
      $M/M/1$ queue. The process
      $Z(t) = Z(0) + N_\lambda(t) - N_\mu(t)$, with $N_\lambda$ and
      $N_\mu$ constructed based on the sequences $\{a_k\}$ and
      $\{c_k\}$, is the continuous-time random walk underlying the
      $M/M/1$ queue.

    \end{solution}
\end{question}

The solution of the above exercise shows that there is no simple
function by which we can compute the transient distribution of 
the  simple random walk $\{Z(t)\}$. Since a queueing process is typically a
more complicated object (as it is a constrained random walk), our
hopes to finding anything simple for the transient analysis of the
$M/M/1$ queue should not be too high. And the $M/M/1$ is but the
simplest queueing system; other queueing systems will be more
complicated yet.  We therefore give up the analysis of such transient
queueing systems and we henceforth contend ourselves with the analysis
of queueing systems in the limit as $t\to\infty$.  This of course
warrants two questions: what type of limit is actually meant here, and
is such limiting situation reached in any reasonable time? We address
these questions subsequently.

The \emph{long-run limiting behavior} of a queueing system is an
important topic by itself. The underlying question is what happens if
we simulate the system for a long time. For instance, does there exist
a random variable $Q$ such that $Q_k\to Q$ in some sense? The answer
to this question is in the affirmative, provided some simple stability
conditions are satisfied, see
Section~\ref{sec:rate-stability}. However, it requires a considerable
amount of mathematics to make this procedure precise. To sketch what
has to be done, first, we need to define $\{Q_k\}$ as random variables
in their own right. Note that up to now we just considered each $Q_k$
as a \emph{number}, i.e., a measurement or simulation of the queue
length time of the $k$th period. Defining $Q_k$ as a random variable
is not as simple as the definition of, for instance, the number of
arrivals $\{a_k\}$; these random variables can be safely
\emph{assumed} to be i.i.d. However, the queue lengths $\{Q_k\}$ are
certainly not i.i.d., but, as should be apparent from
Eq.~\eqref{eq:59}, they are \emph{constructed} in terms of
recursions. Next, based on these recursions, we need to show that the
sequence of distribution functions $\{G_k\}$ associated with the
random variables $\{Q_k\}$ converges to some limiting distribution
function~$G$, say. Finally, it is necessary to show that it is
possible to construct a random variable~$Q$ that has~$G$ as its
distribution function.  In this sense, then, we can say
that~$Q_k \to Q$. The random variable $Q$ is known as the
\recall{steady-state limit} of the sequence of random variables
$\{Q_k\}$, and the distribution $G$ of~$Q$ is known as the
\recall{limiting} or \emph{stationary distribution} of $\{Q_k\}$.

In these notes we sidestep all these fundamental issues, as the
details require measure theory and more advanced probability theory
than we can deal with in this course. However, it can all be made
precise. 

Next, as an example, we address the rate of convergence of the
sequence of waiting times $\{W_{Q,k}\}$ to a limiting random variable
$W_Q$, where $W_{Q,k}$ is constructed according to the recursion
Eq.~(\ref{eq:56}). Suppose that $X_k\sim U\{1,2,4\}$ and
$S_k\sim U\{1,2,3\}$.  Starting with $W_{Q,0}=5$ we use
Eq.~(\ref{eq:56}) to compute the \emph{exact} distribution of
$W_{Q,k}$ for $k=1,2,\ldots, 20$, c.f., the left panel in
Figure~\ref{fig:convergence}. We see that when $k=5$, the `hump' of
$\P{W_{Q,5}=x}$ around $x=5$ is due the starting value of
$W_{Q,0}=5$. However, for $k>10$ the distribution of $W_{Q,k}$ hardly
changes, at least not visually. Apparently, the convergence of the
sequence of distributions of $W_{Q,k}$ is rather fast. In the middle
panel we show the results of a set of \emph{simulations} for
increasing simulation length, up to $N=1000$ samples. Here the
\emph{empirical distribution} for the simulation is defined as
\begin{equation*}
\P{W_Q\leq x} =   \frac 1n n\sum_{k=1}^n \1{W_{Q,k} \leq x},
\end{equation*}
where $W_{Q,k}$ is obtained by simulation. As should be clear from the
figure, the simulated distribution also seems to converge quite fast to
some limiting function. Finally, in the right hand panel we compare
the densities as obtained by the exact method and simulation with
$n=1000$. Clearly, for all practical purposes, these densities can be
treated as the same.

The combination of the fast convergence to the steady-state situation
and the difficulties with the transient analysis validates, to some
extent, that most queueing theory is concerned with the analysis of
the system in \emph{stationarity}. The study of queueing systems in
stationary state will occupy us for the rest of the book.

\begin{question}
  Suppose that $X_k\in\{1,3\}$ such that $\P{X_k=1}=\P{X_k=3}$ and
  $S_k\in\{1,2\}$ with $\P{S_k=1}=\P{S_k=2}$. Write a computer program
  to see how fast the distributions of $W_{Q,k}$ converge to a limiting distribution function.

  \begin{solution}
Here is an example with python. In R it must be equally simple.
I compute the 
difference, i.e., the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic, between
the distributions of $W_k$ and $W_{k+1}$, 
\begin{equation*}
  \max_x\{ |\P{W_{Q,k}\leq x} - \P{W_{Q,k-1}\leq x}|\},
\end{equation*}
for $x$ in the support of $W_{Q,k}$. 

<<term=True,wrap=False>>=
from lea import Lea

S = Lea.fromVals(1,  2)
X = Lea.fromVals(1,  3)
U = S-X

W = Lea.fromVals(3)
for k in range(1, 10):
    W_new = Lea.fastMax(W + U, 0)
    m = max(abs(W_new.cdf(x)-W.cdf(x))  for x in range(W_new.support()[-1]))
    print(k, m) 
    W = W_new

So, after some 10 customers, the distribution hardly changes anymore.
